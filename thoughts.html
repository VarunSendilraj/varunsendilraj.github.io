                personal beliefs and perspectives that shape how i see the world.

                <div class="thought-description">
                    <p>at a school filled with top engineering talent, i've noticed two kinds of people—those chasing clout, and those chasing depth.</p>
                    <p>the ones i admire most aren't optimizing for the next big opportunity. they're obsessed with the craft, driven by curiosity, not recognition.</p>
                    <p>in the end, it's the pursuit of mastery—not fame—that takes them the furthest.</p>

                <div class="thought-description">
                    <p>when i'm stuck, i've learned to step back and work in reverse.</p>
                    <p>sometimes the clearest path forward is found by imagining how i'd fail—then doing the opposite.</p>

                <div class="thought-description">
                    <p>an expert in any field is just someone who's failed in more ways than most around them.</p>
                    <p>this thought helps me welcome failure instead of fearing it. each mistake teaches me something i couldn't have learned otherwise—something i'll carry with me for a lifetime.</p>

                <div class="thought-description">
                    <p>as i get closer to graduation, i've been thinking a lot about what comes next—big tech, grad school, maybe starting something on my own.</p>
                    <p>one thing that's helped is thinking of life like a story: what choice would make it more interesting?</p>
                    <p>sometimes the less obvious path—if it's a calculated risk—ends up being the one that brings the most fulfillment.</p>

                <div class="thought-description">
                    <p>i've never had trouble putting in the work. but after spending time in big tech, startups, academia, and side projects, i've realized something:</p>
                    <p>the difference between the top 1% and the top 0.01% often comes down to how well they communicate and share their work.</p>
                    <p>people won't dig to find out what you've built—it's on you to show them. that's still something i struggle with, especially with the fear of judgment. but i'm learning it's part of the job.</p>

                <h2 class="thought-title">go on more walks</h2>
                <div class="thought-description">
                    <p>walks in nature have become my form of meditation. some of my best thoughts and reflections come when i'm just walking—no music, just me and my thoughts (sometimes out loud).</p>
                    <p>it's how i process everything swirling in my head.</p>
                    <p>this is what grounds me. find your own version of that—and do it often. it brings surprising clarity.</p>

                <h2 class="thought-title">never ask for permission, ask forgiveness</h2>
                <div class="thought-description">
                    <p>in school, we’re taught to follow rules and wait our turn. but that’s not how the real world works.</p>
                    <p>if you really want something, you have to go after it—relentlessly, unapologetically.</p>
                    <p>and if it doesn't go as planned, most people will forgive you—especially if you acted in good faith.</p>
                    <p>sometimes, progress starts by bending the rules a little.</p>
